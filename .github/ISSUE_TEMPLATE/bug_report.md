## **Delete these before you submit a bug report. They're just advices to help me track the bug better.**
**It will be best if you provides screenshots with F3 menu enabled. F3 menu contains lots of information about your environment.**
**Logs are important for bug tracking. Provides the latest.log (in .minecraft/logs) after issues appear. If your game crashed and there are hs_err_pid<id>.log(in .minecraft) that date matches issue happening, provide it too.**
