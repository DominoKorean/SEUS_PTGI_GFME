## **Delete these before you submit a bug report. They're just advices to help me track the bug better.**
**Before reporting a bug, please make sure this is a bug related to this shader but not other mods. Delete all other mods except Optifine or use a standalone Optifine launch profile without Forge/Fabric and test your bug. If it does not happen, it might related to some mod compatibility with shader loader, but not this shader. Notice: mod support issues will get ignored since mods might use rendering functions different from vanilla.**
**This shader is developed on Optifine. If you experience some issue on Iris, make sure this also happens on Optifine first.**
**It will be best if you provides screenshots with F3 menu enabled. F3 menu contains lots of information about your environment.**
**Logs are important for bug tracking. Provides the latest.log (in .minecraft/logs) after issues appear. If your game crashed and there are hs_err_pid<id>.log (in .minecraft) that date matches game crashing, provide it too.**
